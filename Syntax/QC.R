# method of replacing both 0s and NAs with 1 is a practical, albeit simplistic, way to handle missing or biologically absent metabolites, particularly if the goal is to proceed with downstream analyses without interruptions caused by missing values. 

# Consider explicitly annotating the imputed values in  dataset, so the distinction between imputed and original values is retained. For example:


df_filtered_imputed <- df_filtered %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ ifelse(is.na(.) | . == 0, 1, .), .names = "{.col}_imputed_flag"))



# Negative values arising after subtracting average blank values in mass spectrometry-based multi-omics data analysis are indeed a common issue. These negative values typically result from noise or imprecise baseline correction and need to be addressed to maintain biological relevance. 

# 1. Replace Negative Values with a Small Positive Constant

df_clean_to_stat <- df_clean_to_stat %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ ifelse(. < 0, min(df_clean_to_stat[df_clean_to_stat > 0], na.rm = TRUE) * 0.1, .)))

## Here, a small positive constant (10% of the smallest positive value in the dataset) replaces negative values. Negative values can be replaced with a small positive constant close to the detection limit of the instrument. This ensures that log-transformations and other downstream analyses are feasible.


# 2. Set Negative Values to Zero

df_clean_to_stat <- df_clean_to_stat %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ ifelse(. < 0, 0, .)))

## Negative values are treated as "below detection limit" and replaced with 0. This is common in metabolomics and proteomics data preprocessing.


# 3. Use Absolute Values

df_clean_to_stat <- df_clean_to_stat %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), abs))


## Convert all negative values to their absolute counterparts. This assumes the negative values arise from noise and approximates the signal. This is less commonly used because it may misrepresent the data.
